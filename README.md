Converting letters into a grid
==============================

It seemed like a good idea to be able to convert letters into art-like figures as you type.
I am not that creative, but luckily I found Tim Holman's [https://github.com/tholman/image-nodes](https://github.com/tholman/image-nodes)
project. This project creates a small interactive particle system from an image.
Now instead of an image, it takes text and transforms the letters into a grid of dots and lines.
